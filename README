These ipython files were used for my invited tutorial in "Bioinformatics" (2018.11.15, 2018.11.22)
The data used in the files are available @ https://www.kaggle.com/c/gene-expression-prediction/data 

Some snippets from the files were from the codes of my Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree progrm exercises.
